            "information": "This was developed within a French Monster Collecting engine known as PSDK, which utilized Ruby, a little bit of C++, and a graphic engine they developed themselves called LiteRGSS.\r\n\r\n The competition this project was developed for always has a theme and contestants were asked to develop a Pokémon RPG with whatever engine of choice. I decided I'd go for something that would be easier to split in a few weeks, rather than a dedicated gym challenge seen in regular Pokémon games, so this has a fully original story. \r\n\r\nWorking in a team as 4 as the lead developer, I was responsible for:\r\n\r\n- Coming up with the story/gameplay loop. This includes writing all of the dialogue. I split the game into three areas, with 5 hidden \"treasures\" within each. You found these just walking around and exploring the overworld. Collecting them at intervals gave the players various rewards that would help them in battle. They also publicly display at the player's base with fun flavor text. There are also a lot of optional treasures that can still be traded in, but would give a strong random award. Wild Pokémon drop these at a small chance (10%).",
