Would it be weird to post my portfolio on my portfolio?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There's a few challenges here and there with submitting things at the moment, specifically the way the Portolio Item descriptions look kind of...overwhelming right now. And the items don't like to update or indent.</p>\r\n<p>At least, I was able to post a bit of a Ghosts of Knowledge post-mortem. I've definitely grown out of it, but being my first completed project, the things I learned working on it were invaluable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, I need to update the items to be more of a Gallery than a single thumbnail image, and of course, pretty up the rest of the site. I'll try not to overdo the violet/purple/lavender, but I can't promise anything. I think it's really pretty.</p>\r\n",
